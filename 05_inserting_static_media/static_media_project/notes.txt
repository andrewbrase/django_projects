So far we’ve used templates to insert
simple text.
● But we don’t always just want text, what
about other types of media, for example,
returning a User’s Photo?
● Let’s discuss static media files!

To do this, we will create a new directory
inside of the project called static ( just like
we did for templates)
● Then we will add this directory path to the
project’s settings.py file
● We will also add a STATIC_URL variable

Once we’ve done that we need a place to
store our static image files
● We create a directory inside of static
called images
● Place a favorite .jpg file inside this images
directory (or just download one)
