django-admin startproject first_project
- when you create the project you get these files

- __init__.py - This is a blank Python
script that due to its
special name let’s
Python know that this
directory can be treated
as a package

- settings.py - This is where you will
store all your project
settings

- urls.py - This is a Python script
that will store all the
URL patterns for your
project. Basically the
different pages of your
web application.

- wsgi - This is a Python script
that acts as the Web
Server Gateway
Interface. It will later on
help us deploy our web
app to production

- manage.py - This is a Python script
that we will use a lot. It
will be associates with
many commands as we
build our web app!


how to start up server - cd into project folder
python manage.py runserver

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
within the django project- we are creating a django application
python manage.py startapp first_app

when you create the app go back to your code- there will be a new file with :

(another) __init__.py - this is a blank python script that due to its special name lets python know that this directory can be treated as a package

-views.py - This is where you have
functions that handle
requests and return
responses

-tests.py - Here you can store test
functions to test your
code

-models.py - Here you store the
application’s data
models

-apps.py - Here you can place
application specific
configurations

-admin.py - You can register your
models here which
Django will then use
them with Django’s
admin interface.

- migrations folder -
This directory stores
database specific
information as it relates
to the models

- Now we need to tell Django that we just created this app, so we will
 go back to the settings.py file in the project and add in that first app
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
go to installed apps list in the settings folder, we need to add in the
first app
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
now we want to create our first view
go to views.py in the app folder

each view will exist inside of that views.py file as a function

>
from django.http import HttpResponse
def index(request):
    return HttpResponse('Test of HttpResponse')

we created one view called index, each view will take in an argument
- usually request

you can actually return html content as well 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
go to urls.py in the project folder

(this is instructions inside)
"""first_project URL Configuration

The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/http/urls/
Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))
"""

>
from first_app import views
from django.conf.urls import url
(not included when created??)

add in the urlpatterns list - (we will be using regular expressions)
url(r'^$', views.index, name = 'index'),

video 121 next
http://127.0.0.1:8000/first_app/
(the apps can have thir own url.py file that we can then call from the 
projects url patterns

create urls.py in app-
>
from django.conf.urls import url
from first_app import views

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$',views.index,name='index'),
]

>project urls.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path

from django.conf.urls import include
from django.conf.urls import url

from first_app import views
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', views.index, name = 'index'),
    url(r'^newextension/', include('first_app.urls')),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]

Django templates
the Template  will conatin the static parts of an html page
skeleton of the page

then there are Template Tags, which have their own special syntax.
this sytnax allows you to inject dynamic content that your django
apps view will produce, effecting the final html
