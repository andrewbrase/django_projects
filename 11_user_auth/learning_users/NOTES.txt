Django Passwords

In this lecture we will discuss the general set-up to begin getting ready 
for User Authentication. We'll talk about passwords in general and also 
discuss some additional library options for security

in the INSTALLED_APPS list in settings.py,
you need to have these two apps:
django.contrib.auth 
django.contrib.contenttypes

the next thing we need to do is make 
sure we store our passwords safely
NEVER store passwords in plain text!
We will begin by using the default
PBKDF2 algorithm with an SHA256 hash
that's built into django

ther are other methods as well, we will
also show how to use the bcrypt and Argon2.
in your virtual environment
pip install bcrypt
pip install django[argon2]

inside of settings.py you can then pass in 
the list of PASSWORD_HASHERS to try in the 
order you want to try them.

Sometimes users will also try to use a very 
weak password, such as password123
We can also add in validator options to prevent 
a user from doing that.
We'll keep things simple and only require a 
minimum length for now
