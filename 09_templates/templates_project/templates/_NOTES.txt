Django Template filters

if you had some information from your model 
that you wished to use across various views/pages, 
But perhaps you wanted to make a slight edit to the 
information before injecting it, like string 
operations, or arithmetic

ex. on one page have it be all uppercase,
on another page all lowercase

Django provides ways to implement template 
filters that allow you to effect the injection 
before dispalying it to the user. This allows 
for flexibility from a single source

the general form for a template filter is:

{{ value | filter:'parameter' }}
- not all filters take in parameters
many of these filters are based off of common 
built-in Python functions so you will be already 
familiar with them

ex. {{ django|title }}

(context)
{'django','the web framework for perfectionists with deadlines'}

- title is a python string operation that capitalizes the first letter 
of every word in a string

result: The Web Framework For Perfectionists With Deadlines
- some filters take an argument
{{ my_date|date:"Y-m-d" }}
